# LinkedIn Feed Locker Browser Extension
A browser extension to lock the LinkedIn feed from the view, helping distracted person to remain **focused** with the option of still accessing the feed.

Example of what it looks like with the extension:
![The feed is locked and a button appears on top to unlock it](/docs/locked.png "The feed is locked and a button appears on top to unlock it")

You can still press the button for 1.5 seconds to unlock the feed:
![A progress bar appears on click](/docs/unlocking.png "A progress bar appears on click")

People posting on LinkedIn are getting better and better every day at catching your attention (and mine!). 

They post entrancing pictures and gripping hooks to get you to read their content. 

And they are right to do so!

But you also have to protect your attention.

With this tool, your feed is locked by default, and you still have the opportunity to read it by pressing the unlock button.
